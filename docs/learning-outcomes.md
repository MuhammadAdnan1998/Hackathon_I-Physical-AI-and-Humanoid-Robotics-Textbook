# Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Foundational Robotics and AI:** Understand the core concepts of the modern robotics stack, including ROS, AI principles, kinematics, and dynamics, and their interplay in developing autonomous systems.
2.  **Perception and Cognition:** Apply advanced techniques in robot perception, utilizing computer vision, LiDAR, localization, and mapping (SLAM) to enable robots to interpret and navigate complex environments.
3.  **Autonomous Navigation and Control:** Design and implement robust motion planning algorithms, control systems (e.g., PID, Model Predictive Control), and reinforcement learning strategies for autonomous robot navigation, manipulation, and decision-making.
4.  **Human-Robot Interaction and Swarm Systems:** Analyze principles of effective human-robot interaction, explore social robotics concepts, and design decentralized control strategies for coordinating multi-robot swarm systems.
5.  **Advanced Robotics Paradigms:** Evaluate and apply concepts from bio-inspired robotics (e.g., legged and soft robotics) and understand the transformative impact of robotics within Industry 4.0, including collaborative robots (cobots) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs).
6.  **Ethical Considerations and Future Trends:** Critically assess the ethical implications of advanced robotics, including issues of bias, fairness, and autonomous weapons, and articulate the emerging trends at the convergence of AI, robotics, and quantum computing.
