# Assessments

This course will assess your understanding and practical skills through a combination of projects designed to progressively build your expertise in agentic development and humanoid robotics. Each assessment focuses on a key aspect of the course material, culminating in a comprehensive capstone project.

## 1. ROS 2 Package Development

*   **Objective:** To demonstrate proficiency in developing and integrating modular components within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework.
*   **Description:** Students will develop a ROS 2 package that implements a specific robotic functionality (e.g., sensor data processing, basic navigation, or a simple manipulation task). This will involve creating custom ROS 2 nodes, publishers, subscribers, services, and actions, and ensuring proper inter-node communication and data flow.
*   **Key Learning Outcomes Addressed:** Foundational Robotics and AI.

## 2. Gazebo Simulation Environment Setup and Control

*   **Objective:** To gain practical experience in setting up and controlling robotic systems within a realistic physics-based simulation environment using Gazebo.
*   **Description:** Students will create a custom Gazebo simulation world, import a robot model (URDF/SDF), and implement basic control algorithms to make the robot perform a simple task (e.g., move to a target, avoid obstacles). This assessment emphasizes understanding of robot dynamics and simulation tools.
*   **Key Learning Outcomes Addressed:** Foundational Robotics and AI, Autonomous Navigation and Control.

## 3. NVIDIA Isaac Perception Module

*   **Objective:** To develop and integrate a perception module leveraging NVIDIA Isaac SDK for advanced sensor data processing and environmental understanding.
*   **Description:** Utilizing NVIDIA Isaac Sim and its perception capabilities, students will implement a module that processes sensor data (e.g., camera, LiDAR) from a simulated robot to identify objects, segment environments, or perform other perception-related tasks. This assessment focuses on applying AI techniques for robotic perception.
*   **Key Learning Outcomes Addressed:** Perception and Cognition, Advanced Robotics Paradigms.

## 4. Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

*   **Objective:** To integrate knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to design, implement, and demonstrate a fully autonomous system capable of complex interaction within a simulated environment.
*   **Description:** The Autonomous Humanoid. A final project where a simulated robot receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies an object using computer vision, and manipulates it. This project requires the synthesis of ROS 2 framework knowledge, perception, navigation, manipulation, and decision-making capabilities.
*   **Key Learning Outcomes Addressed:** All Learning Outcomes.
