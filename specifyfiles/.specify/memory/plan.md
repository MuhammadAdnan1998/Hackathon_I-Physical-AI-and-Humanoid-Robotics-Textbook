# Implementation Plan: Online Book Foundational Structure

**Feature Branch**: `feat/book-structure-initial`
**Date**: 2025-12-06
**Spec**: `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/spec.md`

## 1. Summary

This plan outlines the technical steps required to create the foundational file and directory structure for the online book, "The Guide to Modern Agentic Development". The implementation will scaffold the main content pages and the complete 13-week modular structure within the Docusaurus `docs` directory. The approach is designed to leverage Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars for maintainability, directly fulfilling the requirements of the project specification and constitution.

## 2. Constitution Check

This plan strictly adheres to the principles defined in `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

*   ✅ **Technical Platform Principle**: All custom components will use TypeScript. The plan focuses on Markdown files, which is platform-agnostic.
*   ✅ **Context7 Principle**: All subsequent automated actions to populate content will adhere to this principle.
*   ✅ **Content Principle**: The core of this plan is to create the 13-week modular structure mandated by the constitution.
*   ✅ **Hardware Principle**: The plan includes the creation of a dedicated file for the "Hardware Requirements".

## 3. Project Structure and Implementation

The following file and directory structure will be created within the `docs` directory.

### 3.1. Top-Level Content Pages

These files will serve as the primary informational pages for the book.

```text
docs/
├── learning-outcomes.md
├── hardware-requirements.md
└── assessments.md
```

### 3.2. Weekly Module Structure

A directory will be created for each of the 13 weeks. This modular structure directly maps to the course syllabus and the content principle of the constitution.

```text
docs/
├── week-1/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-2/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-3/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-4/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-5/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-6/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-7/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-8/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-9/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-10/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-11/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
├── week-12/
│   ├── _category_.json
│   └── introduction.md
└── week-13/
    ├── _category_.json
    └── introduction.md
```

### 3.3. Category Configuration

Each `_category_.json` file will contain JSON to define the sidebar label for its respective week, ensuring a clean and ordered navigation experience. For example, `docs/week-1/_category_.json` will contain:

```json
{
  "label": "Week 1 - Introduction to AI and Robotics",
  "position": 1
}
```
*(Note: Labels for weeks 2-13 will be populated with their respective topics during implementation.)*

## 4. Sidebar Strategy

The `sidebars.ts` file is currently configured for autogeneration (`tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}]`). This plan will **leverage this feature**. By creating the directory structure outlined above with corresponding `_category_.json` files, the sidebar will be generated automatically.

**This approach requires NO manual edits to `sidebars.ts`** and ensures that the sidebar remains in sync with the file system, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

## 5. High-Level Implementation Steps

1.  **Create Top-Level Pages**: Create the empty markdown files: `learning-outcomes.md`, `hardware-requirements.md`, and `assessments.md` in the `docs/` directory.
2.  **Scaffold Weekly Modules**: Programmatically create the directory structure for `week-1` through `week-13`.
3.  **Populate Categories**: In each weekly directory, create a `_category_.json` file with the appropriate `label` and `position`.
4.  **Create Placeholder Content**: In each weekly directory, create a placeholder `introduction.md` file to ensure the category is not empty.
5.  **Verification**: Run the Docusaurus development server to confirm that all new pages and 13 weekly modules appear correctly in the autogenerated sidebar.
