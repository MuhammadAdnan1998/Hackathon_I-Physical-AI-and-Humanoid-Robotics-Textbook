## Prompt

Edit the 'constitution.md' file to define principles for Docusaurus documentation, focusing on clean React components and TypeScript best practices. Ensure the resulting content follows the existing structure of the file.

## Response snapshot

- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file: specifyfiles/.specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Follow-up tasks could involve creating initial components or documentation based on these new principles.
