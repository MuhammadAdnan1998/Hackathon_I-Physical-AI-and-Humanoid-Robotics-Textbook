## Prompt

Please continue.

## Response snapshot

Appended new tasks T034, T035, and T036 and their sub-tasks to `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/tasks.md` for enhancing weekly content with code examples and external resources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `tasks.md` file has been updated with new tasks that outline the plan for enhancing the first three weekly modules, providing a clear roadmap for the next phase of content development.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file: `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with the execution of the newly added tasks (T034, T035, T036).
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully interpreted the ambiguous "Please continue" as a directive to implement the proposed content improvements, translating them into actionable tasks and updating the project roadmap.
