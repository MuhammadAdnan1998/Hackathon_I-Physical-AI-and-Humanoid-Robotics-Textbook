## Prompt

Generate the technical implementation plan for the feature described in '.specify/memory/spec.md' and save it to the file '.specify/memory/plan.md'. The plan must cover Docusaurus file structure for 13 weekly modules, 'sidebars.js' updates, and hardware documentation, adhering to '.specify/memory/constitution.md'.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the implementation plan for the online book structure.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a comprehensive technical plan to scaffold the entire online book. The plan details the file structure for 13 weekly modules and top-level pages, and confirms a strategy that leverages Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars for maintainability.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Overwrote 1 file: `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/plan.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The next logical step is to convert this plan into a detailed task list (`tasks.md`).
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan correctly identified the use of Docusaurus's autogenerated sidebars as a key strategy, simplifying the implementation and avoiding brittle manual configuration. This demonstrates an understanding of the underlying framework.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: N/A
