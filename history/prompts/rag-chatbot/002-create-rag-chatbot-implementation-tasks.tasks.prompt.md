## Prompt

Review the new RAG Chatbot plan appended in '.specify/memory/plan.md' and convert it into a sequence of small, individual, and actionable implementation tasks. Append these new tasks, starting immediately after the last task, to the file '.specify/memory/tasks.md'.

## Response snapshot

I have generated the implementation tasks for the RAG Chatbot and appended them to `specifyfiles/.specify/memory/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The implementation tasks for the RAG chatbot are now documented.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementing the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The tasks are broken down into small, manageable steps, which should make implementation straightforward.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
